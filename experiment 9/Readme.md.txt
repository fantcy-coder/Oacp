Intuition
Start from 1, if found then search for 2 and so on.
If not found then add it.(Maintain a variable ans which stores number of elements that are added).
Maintain a variable sum, which calculate sum of the elements in the array (including those which are newly added).

NOTE: If sum=x, then it's always possible to make any number between(1 to x).
