The provided C++ code aims to determine the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from two arrays tabn and tabm, where each pair consists of elements with a difference of at most one. Initially, the code reads the sizes of the arrays n and m, followed by their respective elements. It then sorts both arrays in ascending order. Using two pointers a and b initialized to 0, the code iterates through both arrays simultaneously. At each step, it compares the absolute difference between the elements pointed to by a and b. If the difference is at most one, the code increments the count w and advances both pointers. If the element in tabm is smaller than that in tabn, b is advanced, and if it's larger, a is advanced. This process continues until one of the arrays is fully traversed. Finally, the code prints the count of valid pairs w. This algorithm leverages the efficiency of sorting and two-pointer technique to achieve a linear time complexity of O(n + m).
